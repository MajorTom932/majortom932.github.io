During my time as a research assistant supervised by Supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Zhao](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiuhua-Li-2), I studied various NLP-related concepts such as Hidden Markov Models, LSTMs, and Transformers. I also attempted to improve the RNN-T model by integrating a VGG16 network as a feature extraction module at the input layer to capture temporal context information. In addition, I employed an SEnet-style gating mechanism to control which information in the channel domain should be propagated to the RNN-T model. I have strong programming skills in both Python and C++, and I am familiar with the model development workflow using the Tensorflow framework.
